## Personal Info QR code

### The goal of this project is to enhance the developers skills in deployment and typescript.

### This project takes user's info and generates a one time QR code in which they can view their personal info after they scan code.

### FE

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To run this project locally,

1. Run `yarn` to install package dependencies
2. Run `yarn start` to serve the app
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deployment

This project can be deployed via Vercel just as how we deployed this for production use. It is the platform for frontend developers, providing the speed and reliability innovators need to create at the moment of inspiration. Every personal account on Vercel is a Hobby account. Hobby accounts are free of charge forever and are for personal, non-commercial use.
To start deployment,

1. Create an account on Vercel (https://vercel.com/dashboard). Preferably, sign in using your Github account.
2. Import the project into Vercel.
3. Vercel will detect that you are using React for this instance and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.
4. Add the Project Name
5. Add your environment variables (e.g. REACT_APP_API_ORIGIN)
6. Click Deploy
7. Your application is then deployed! (e.g. upskill-fe-lake.vercel.app)
